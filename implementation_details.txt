    # Note: For very specific clinical data (like "diagnosis", "medication_count"),
    # DLP might require custom InfoTypes with regex patterns if they don't
    # fit a standard built-in category. However, some basic health-related PII
    # like DATE_OF_BIRTH, GENDER, AGE, PERSON_NAME etc. are covered under PII.

    {"name": "HEALTHCARE_PROVIDER_ID"},    # Identifiers for healthcare providers
    {"name": "PHONE_NUMBER"},              # Phone numbers can be PHI if linked to health data

    {"name": "DATE"},                      # Generic dates related to health events (e.g., hospital visit dates)
    {"name": "DISEASE"},                   # Names of diseases (DLP has limited detection for this, often needs custom)
